                    <h3>1. Check the laptop keyboard</h3> 
                    <p className="container">- If you are planning on buying those kind of laptop you should take note of the keyboards 
                    because if you are not familiar with the standard keyboard key especially for symbols, you might end up guessing on where is the symbols that you are used to.

                    <h3>2. Battery Capacity</h3>
                    <p className="container">- Make sure to not expect more in terms of battery because only few of this laptops did not have high capacity of mAh of battery. 
                        There are some cases that the laptop has more battery capacity but it is like winning lottery </p></span>

                    <h3>3. Weight</h3>
                    <p className="container">- As experienced, most of Nec, Toshiba and Fujitsu laptops (not netbook) is a little bit heavy compare to new and slim type laptops. 
                    It is because of its durability, althought it is heavy but the reason of it is its quality. 
                    Approximately 2.5 kgs is the weight of one laptop. It is quality versus portability</p>
